<h3> New types object extensions </h3>

<b> Symbol </b> </br>
<p>Symbol is a unique and immutable data type and may be used as identifier for object properties</p> </br>

use case :
- to provide the unique id ( it is difficult to predict the unique id that is generated or inspect and know what it is)
- when you want to add properties to all the classes in your software project and keep them unique , for security reasons
- maybe to avoid overlapping

```
const eventSymbol = Symbol('resize event');
console.log(typeof eventSymbol) // symbol
console.log(eventSymbol.toString()) // resize event
```
<p style={{ color: green}}> when a string is passed to Symbol constructor function a new symbol is created with the unique id with the type being <b>symbol</b></p>

```
const s1 = Symbol('event');
const s2 = Symbol('event');
console.log( s1 === s2 ) // false

```
<p> hence the symbols created are unique </p>
